Deathworks
A funeral industries job board where users can post vacancies and/or apply to open positions as well as use some social media aspects to network within the industry.

How It's Made
Tech Used: MongoDB, Express, Boostrap, and Node with multer and cloudinary for image storage.

This app is still under construction! I have plenty of to-dos but am currently working on adding accessibility features before adding search functionality.
Some of these to-dos include:
-internal notifications such as new questions or answers to questions a user has asked
-viewing archived listings only

# Create .env file

create a .env file that connects to your MongoDB and Cloudinary accounts as well as a PORT for local testing
