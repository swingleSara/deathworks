Deathworks
A funeral industries jobboard where users can post vacancies and/or apply to open positions as well as use some social media aspects to network within the industry.

How It's Made
Tech Used: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) with multer and cloudinary for image storage.

This app is still under construction! I have plenty of todos but am currently working on the frontend to make the UI/UX bearable.  I would also like to add a quick-apply funciton at some point in the future.

# Install Dependencies

npm install

# Create .env file

create a .env file that connects to your MongoDB and Cloudinary accounts as well as a PORT for local testing

# Run in Development

npm run dev

# Run in Production

npm start
