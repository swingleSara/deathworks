Deathworks
A funeral industries jobboard where users can post vacancies and/or apply to open positions as well as use some social media aspects to network within the industry.

How It's Made
Tech Used: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) with multer and cloudinary for image storage.

This app is still under construction! I have plenty of todos but am currently working on an application form to quick-apply to positions as well as a means to leave questions to be answered by the hiring manager.

# Install Dependencies
